      "content": "PolicyThoughts on America’s AI Action PlanJul 23, 2025●6 min readToday, the White House released \"Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan\"—a comprehensive strategy to maintain America's advantage in AI development. We are encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination. Many of the plan’s recommendations reflect Anthropic’s response to the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) prior request for information. While the plan positions America for AI advancement, we believe strict export controls and AI development transparency standards remain crucial next steps for securing American AI leadership.Accelerating AI infrastructure and adoptionThe Action Plan prioritizes AI infrastructure and adoption, consistent with Anthropic’s submission to OSTP in March.We applaud the Administration's commitment to streamlining data center and energy permitting to address AI’s power needs. As we stated in our OSTP submission and at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, without adequate domestic energy capacity, American AI developers may be forced to relocate operations overseas, potentially exposing sensitive technology to foreign adversaries. Our recently published “Build AI in America” report details the steps the Administration can take to accelerate the buildout of our nation’s AI infrastructure, and we look forward to working with the Administration on measures to expand domestic energy capacity.The Plan’s recommendations to increase the federal government's adoption of AI also includes proposals that are closely aligned with Anthropic’s policy priorities and recommendations to the White House. These include:Tasking the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to address resource constraints, procurement limitations, and programmatic obstacles to federal AI adoption.Launching a Request for Information (RFI) to identify federal regulations that impede AI innovation, with OMB coordinating reform efforts.Updating federal procurement standards to remove barriers that prevent agencies from deploying AI systems.Promoting AI adoption across defense and national security applications through public-private collaboration.Democratizing AI’s benefitsWe are aligned with the Action Plan’s focus on ensuring broad participation in and benefit from AI’s continued development and deployment.The Action Plan’s continuation of the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot ensures that students and researchers across the country can participate in and contribute to the advancement of the AI frontier. We have long supported the NAIRR and are proud of our partnership with the pilot program. Further, the Action Plan’s emphasis on rapid retraining programs for displaced workers and pre-apprenticeship AI programs recognizes the errors of prior technological transitions and demonstrates a commitment to delivering AI’s benefits to all Americans.Complementing these proposals are our efforts to understand how AI is transforming, and how it will transform, our economy. The Economic Index and the Economic Futures Program aim to provide researchers and policymakers with the data and tools they need to ensure AI’s economic benefits are broadly shared and risks are appropriately managed.Promoting secure AI developmentPowerful AI systems are going to be developed in the coming years. The plan’s emphasis on defending against the misuse of powerful AI models and preparing for future AI related risks is appropriate and excellent. In particular, we commend...",

We plan to release substantially larger improvements to our models in the coming weeks.Opus 4.1 is now available to paid Claude users and in Claude Code. It's also on our API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Pricing is the same as Opus 4.Claude Opus 4.1Opus 4.1 advances our state-of-the-art coding performance to 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified. It also improves Claude’s in-depth research and data analysis skills, especially around detail tracking and agentic search.GitHub notes that Claude Opus 4.1 improves across most capabilities relative to Opus 4, with particularly notable performance gains in multi-file code refactoring. Rakuten Group finds that Opus 4.1 excels at pinpointing exact corrections within large codebases without making unnecessary adjustments or introducing bugs, with their team preferring this precision for everyday debugging tasks. Windsurf reports Opus 4.1 delivers a one standard deviation improvement over Opus 4 on their junior developer benchmark, showing roughly the same performance leap as the jump from Sonnet 3.7 to Sonnet 4.Getting startedWe recommend upgrading from Opus 4 to Opus 4.1 for all uses. If you’re a developer, simply use claude-opus-4-1-20250805 via the API. You can also explore our system card, model page, pricing page, and docs to learn more.As always, your feedback helps us improve, especially as we continue to release new and more capable models.AppendixData sourcesOpenAI: o3 launch post, o3 system cardGemini: 2.5 Pro model cardClaude: Sonnet 3.7 launch post, Claude 4 launch postBenchmark reportingClaude models are hybrid reasoning models. The benchmarks reported in this blog post show the highest scores achieved with or without extended thinking. We’ve noted below for each result whether extended thinking was used:No extended thinking: SWE-bench Verified, Terminal-BenchThe following benchmarks were reported with extended thinking (up to 64K tokens): TAU-bench, GPQA Diamond, MMMLU, MMMU, AIMETAU-bench methodologyScores were achieved with a prompt addendum to both the Airline and Retail Agent Policy instructing Claude to better leverage its reasoning abilities while using extended thinking with tool use. The model is encouraged to write down its thoughts as it solves the problem distinct from our usual thinking mode, during the multi-turn trajectories to best leverage its reasoning abilities. To accommodate the additional steps Claude incurs by utilizing more thinking, the maximum number of steps (counted by model completions) was increased from 30 to 100 (most trajectories completed under 30 steps with only one trajectory reaching above 50 steps).SWE-bench methodologyFor the Claude 4 family of models, we continue to use the same simple scaffold that equips the model with solely the two tools described in our prior releases here—a bash tool, and a file editing tool that operates via string replacements. We no longer include the third ‘planning tool’ used by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. On all Claude 4 models, we report scores out of the full 500 problems.
